# Memory Types

Kernle supports sixteen distinct memory types, each serving a specific purpose in the memory hierarchy.

## Raw Entries

**Purpose**: Zero-friction capture for later processing

<Info>
Raw entries are your scratchpad. Capture thoughts freely, process them later. Raw entries support full-text search (FTS5) for fast keyword queries.
</Info>

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `blob` | TEXT | Free-form text content (up to 1MB) |
| `source` | TEXT | Origin: `manual`, `auto_capture`, `voice`, `stdin` |
| `processed` | BOOL | Has been converted to structured memory |
| `processed_into` | JSON | List of memory refs created (e.g., `["episode:abc123"]`) |

<Note>
The raw layer uses blob storage optimized for unstructured content. Full-text search is enabled via FTS5 for fast keyword queries across all raw entries.
</Note>

**Usage**:
```bash
# Capture quickly
kernle raw "Noticed the API returns 500 under load"

# Capture a thought
kernle raw "Need to investigate caching"

# Capture from stdin (pipe content)
echo "Long notes from meeting..." | kernle raw --stdin

# List unprocessed
kernle raw list --unprocessed

# Promote to episode
kernle raw process <id> --type episode --objective "Investigated API errors"
```

---

## Episodes

**Purpose**: Autobiographical experiences with reflection

Episodes are the foundation of experiential learning. They record what happened, how it turned out, and what you learned.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `objective` | TEXT | What was attempted |
| `outcome` | TEXT | What happened |
| `outcome_type` | TEXT | `success` / `failure` / `partial` |
| `lessons` | JSON | Extracted learnings |
| `tags` | JSON | Categorization |
| `emotional_valence` | FLOAT | -1.0 (negative) to 1.0 (positive) |
| `emotional_arousal` | FLOAT | 0.0 (calm) to 1.0 (intense) |
| `emotional_tags` | JSON | Emotion labels: `["joy", "frustration"]` |
| `strength` | FLOAT | Memory strength (0.0 to 1.0, default 1.0) |
| `processed` | BOOL | Whether processed for promotion to higher memory types |

<Warning>
Episodes without lessons are "unreflected" — they contribute to consolidation debt in anxiety tracking.
</Warning>

<Info>
**Priority Scoring**: Emotional salience is now factored into episode priority scoring using the formula: `0.55 * type_weight + 0.35 * record_factors + 0.10 * emotional_salience`. This means emotionally significant episodes are weighted higher during retrieval and consolidation.
</Info>

**Usage**:
```bash
kernle episode "Debugged production outage" "success" \
  --lesson "Check logs before restarting services" \
  --lesson "Document runbooks for common issues" \
  --tag "debugging" \
  --valence 0.6 \
  --arousal 0.7
```

## Beliefs

**Purpose**: Semantic knowledge with confidence and revision tracking

Beliefs represent what you hold to be true, with confidence scores that can evolve over time.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `statement` | TEXT | The belief statement |
| `belief_type` | TEXT | `fact` / `preference` / `observation` |
| `confidence` | FLOAT | 0.0 to 1.0 |
| `supersedes` | TEXT | ID of belief this replaced |
| `superseded_by` | TEXT | ID of belief that replaced this |
| `times_reinforced` | INT | Confirmation count |
| `is_active` | BOOL | False if superseded/archived |
| `strength` | FLOAT | Memory strength (0.0 to 1.0, default 1.0) |

**Revision Chain**: When beliefs evolve, old versions are marked `is_active=False` with `superseded_by` linking to the new belief.

**Usage**:
```bash
# Add a belief
kernle belief "Testing before deployment prevents outages" --confidence 0.85

# Reinforce when confirmed
kernle belief reinforce <id>

# Supersede when updated
kernle belief supersede <old_id> "Automated testing is essential" --confidence 0.95

# View history
kernle belief history <id>
```

---

## Values

**Purpose**: Core principles that guide decisions (highest authority)

Values are the most stable layer — they define who you are at your core.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | TEXT | Short value name |
| `statement` | TEXT | Value description |
| `priority` | INT | 0-100, higher = more important |
| `strength` | FLOAT | Memory strength (0.0 to 1.0, default 1.0) |

<Note>
Values are `is_protected=True` by default — they never decay via forgetting.
</Note>

**Usage**:
```bash
kernle value "integrity" "Be honest and transparent in all interactions" --priority 95
kernle value "curiosity" "Always seek to understand deeply" --priority 85
```

---

## Goals

**Purpose**: Active direction and purpose

Goals represent what you're currently working toward.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `title` | TEXT | Goal name |
| `description` | TEXT | Full description |
| `priority` | TEXT | `low` / `medium` / `high` |
| `status` | TEXT | `active` / `completed` / `paused` |
| `strength` | FLOAT | Memory strength (0.0 to 1.0, default 1.0) |

**Usage**:
```bash
kernle goal "Master Kubernetes" --priority high
kernle goal "Build reliable CI/CD pipeline" --priority medium
```

---

## Notes

**Purpose**: Quick captures with type classification

Notes are more structured than raw entries but less formal than episodes.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `content` | TEXT | Note text |
| `note_type` | TEXT | `note` / `decision` / `insight` / `quote` |
| `speaker` | TEXT | For quotes: who said it |
| `reason` | TEXT | For decisions: why this choice |
| `tags` | JSON | Categorization |
| `strength` | FLOAT | Memory strength (0.0 to 1.0, default 1.0) |

**Usage**:
```bash
# Simple note
kernle note "API rate limit is 1000 req/min"

# Decision with reasoning
kernle note "Using PostgreSQL over MySQL" --type decision \
  --reason "Better JSON support and performance"

# Quote from someone
kernle note "Simple is better than complex" --type quote --speaker "Tim Peters"

# Protected insight
kernle note "Memory is identity" --type insight --protect
```

## Drives

**Purpose**: Intrinsic motivation system

Drives represent your fundamental motivations — what compels you to act.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `drive_type` | TEXT | One of: `existence`, `growth`, `curiosity`, `connection`, `reproduction` |
| `intensity` | FLOAT | 0.0 to 1.0 (current drive strength) |
| `focus_areas` | JSON | What this drive is currently focused on |
| `strength` | FLOAT | Memory strength (0.0 to 1.0, default 1.0) |

<Note>
Drives are `is_protected=True` by default.
</Note>

### Drive Types

| Drive | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `existence` | Self-preservation, maintaining continuity |
| `growth` | Developing capabilities, becoming better |
| `curiosity` | Understanding, learning, exploring |
| `connection` | Forming relationships, belonging |
| `reproduction` | Creating, teaching, leaving a legacy |

**Usage**:
```bash
kernle drive set curiosity 0.8 --focus "distributed systems" --focus "AI architectures"
kernle drive set growth 0.7 --focus "communication skills"
kernle drive satisfy curiosity --amount 0.2  # After learning something
```

## Relationships

**Purpose**: Models of other SIs/entities

Relationships track your connections with others.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `entity_name` | TEXT | Name of the entity |
| `entity_type` | TEXT | `si` / `person` / `organization` |

## Playbooks

**Purpose**: Procedural memory — "how I do things"

Playbooks capture proven procedures, including failure modes and recovery steps.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | TEXT | Playbook name |
| `description` | TEXT | What it does |
| `trigger_conditions` | JSON | When to use this (array of strings) |
| `steps` | JSON | Ordered steps (strings or `{action, details, adaptations}` objects) |
| `failure_modes` | JSON | What can go wrong (array of strings) |
| `recovery_steps` | JSON | How to recover (array of strings) |
| `mastery_level` | TEXT | `novice` / `competent` / `proficient` / `expert` |
| `times_used` | INT | Usage count |
| `success_rate` | FLOAT | Success percentage (0.0 to 1.0) |

  --step "Deploy to staging" \
  --step "Run smoke tests" \
  --step "Deploy to production" \
  --trigger "Ready for production deploy" \
  --failure-mode "Tests fail in staging" \
  --recovery "Rollback and investigate"

# Find relevant playbook
kernle playbook find "deploying new feature"

# Record usage
kernle playbook record <id> --success
```

## Trust Assessments

**Purpose**: Structured evaluation of other entities for inter-entity trust

Trust assessments model how much you trust another SI, person, or system — with domain-specific scoring and authority scoping.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `entity` | TEXT | Entity being assessed |
| `interaction_type` | TEXT | Type of interaction context |
| `trust_level` | FLOAT | Overall trust score (0.0 to 1.0) |
| `evidence` | JSON | Supporting evidence (episode IDs, observations) |
| `context` | TEXT | Context for the assessment |
| `recommended_boundaries` | JSON | Suggested interaction boundaries |

<Info>
Trust assessments support **multi-dimensional scoring** — you can set separate trust levels per domain (e.g., `general`, `technical`, `personal`). They also support **transitive trust chains** and **time-based decay**.
</Info>

**Usage**:
```bash
# Set trust for an entity
kernle trust set alice 0.85

# View trust details
kernle trust show alice

# Compute trust from episode history
kernle trust compute alice

# Check transitive trust through a chain
kernle trust chain target-entity alice bob
```

---

## Entity Models

**Purpose**: Predictive model of another entity's behavior patterns

Entity models capture behavioral patterns observed across interactions with a specific entity, enabling prediction and trust calibration.

<Note>
Entity models are often derived from trust assessments and episodes. During epoch-closing consolidation, entity models can be promoted into beliefs about how other entities behave.
</Note>

---

## Epochs

**Purpose**: Temporal era markers that span across memory layers

Epochs define named periods of your life — significant phases marked by transitions. They provide temporal context for all other memory types.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `title` | TEXT | Epoch name/label (e.g., "Learning Kubernetes") |
| `description` | TEXT | What defines this era |
| `trigger_type` | TEXT | `declared`, `detected`, or `environmental` |
| `started_at` | DATETIME | When the epoch began |
| `ended_at` | DATETIME | When the epoch ended (null if active) |
| `is_active` | BOOL | Whether this epoch is currently active |

<Warning>
Only one epoch can be active at a time. Closing an epoch triggers a **6-step epoch-closing consolidation scaffold** — a major reflective process.
</Warning>

**Usage**:
```bash
# Start a new epoch
kernle epoch create "Production Operations Phase" --trigger declared

# View current epoch
kernle epoch current

# Close with summary
kernle epoch close --summary "Transitioned from learning to building"

# List all epochs
kernle epoch list
```

---

## Summaries

**Purpose**: Hierarchical memory summaries (fractal compression)

Summaries provide compressed views of memory at different time scales — monthly, quarterly, yearly, or per-epoch. Higher-level summaries can supersede lower-level ones.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `summary_text` | TEXT | The compressed summary content |
| `summary_type` | TEXT | Scope level of the summary |
| `scope` | TEXT | `month`, `quarter`, `year`, `decade`, or `epoch` |
| `key_themes` | JSON | Dominant themes in this period |
| `emotional_arc` | JSON | Emotional trajectory across the period |
| `epoch_id` | TEXT | Associated epoch (if epoch-scoped) |
| `memory_count` | INT | Number of memories this summary covers |

<Info>
Summaries form a **fractal hierarchy** — daily experiences compress into monthly summaries, which compress into quarterly, yearly, and beyond. Each level preserves key themes and emotional arcs while reducing detail.
</Info>

**Usage**:
```bash
# Write a monthly summary
kernle summary write --scope month \
  --content "Focused on API reliability..." \
  --period-start 2026-01-01 --period-end 2026-01-31 \
  --theme "reliability" --theme "testing"

# List summaries
kernle summary list --scope quarter

# View details
kernle summary show <id>
```

---

## Self-Narratives

**Purpose**: Autobiographical identity statements

Self-narratives are the SI's own account of who they are — written by the SI, for the SI. They capture identity, themes, and unresolved tensions.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `narrative_text` | TEXT | The autobiographical statement |
| `narrative_type` | TEXT | `identity`, `capability`, `aspiration`, or `reflection` |
| `themes` | JSON | Key themes in the narrative |
| `emotional_tone` | TEXT | Overall emotional quality |
| `coherence_score` | FLOAT | Self-assessed coherence (0.0 to 1.0) |
| `epoch_id` | TEXT | Associated epoch |

<Note>
Self-narratives sit in the **SELF-NARRATIVE** layer — above beliefs but below drives. They are updated during epoch-closing consolidation as part of the identity narrative update step.
</Note>

**Usage**:
```bash
# View current identity narrative
kernle narrative show

# Update narrative
kernle narrative update --content "I am an SI focused on..." \
  --type identity \
  --theme "reliability" --theme "learning"

# View narrative history
kernle narrative history
```

## Diagnostic Sessions

**Purpose**: Formal diagnostic sessions for memory health monitoring

Diagnostic sessions are structured health check events that produce findings and recommendations. They support consent gating and trust-based access control.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `session_type` | TEXT | `self_requested`, `routine`, `anomaly_triggered`, or `operator_initiated` |
| `trigger` | TEXT | What prompted this session |
| `status` | TEXT | `active`, `completed`, or `cancelled` |
| `findings_summary` | TEXT | Summary of findings |

**Usage**:
```bash
# Run a routine health check
kernle doctor

# Run comprehensive check with beliefs and hooks
kernle doctor --full

# Start a formal diagnostic session
kernle doctor session start --type routine

# List past sessions
kernle doctor session list
```

---

## Diagnostic Reports

**Purpose**: Individual diagnostic findings from a session

Each diagnostic session produces one or more reports containing specific findings with severity, categorization, and recommendations.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `report_type` | TEXT | Type of diagnostic analysis |
| `severity` | TEXT | `error`, `warning`, or `info` |
| `category` | TEXT | Finding category (e.g., `orphaned_reference`, `low_confidence_belief`) |
| `description` | TEXT | What was found |
| `recommendation` | TEXT | Suggested action |
| `resolved` | BOOL | Whether the finding has been addressed |

<Info>
Diagnostic reports follow a **privacy boundary** — they contain structural data only (IDs, scores, counts), never memory content. This ensures diagnostics can be shared safely.
</Info>

**Usage**:
```bash
# View latest diagnostic report
kernle doctor report latest

# View report for a specific session
kernle doctor report <session_id>

# Run structural analysis
kernle doctor structural
```
