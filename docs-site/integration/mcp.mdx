# MCP Integration

Kernle provides an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes memory operations as tools for AI assistants.

## What is MCP?

MCP is a protocol that allows AI assistants to use external tools. When you add Kernle as an MCP server, your AI assistant gains access to memory operations like:

- Loading working memory
- Saving checkpoints
- Recording episodes and notes
- Searching memory
- Managing beliefs and values

## Starting the MCP Server

```bash
kernle -a <agent_id> mcp
```

This starts an MCP server using stdio transport. The server stays running and responds to tool calls from the connected client.

## Available Tools

When connected, the MCP server exposes these tools:

### Core Memory Operations

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `memory_load` | Load working memory with token budget |
| `memory_checkpoint_save` | Save checkpoint with task description |
| `memory_checkpoint_load` | Load previous checkpoint |
| `memory_checkpoint_clear` | Clear current checkpoint |
| `memory_status` | Get memory statistics |

### Memory Capture

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `memory_episode` | Record an experience with lessons |
| `memory_note` | Capture a note (decision/insight/quote) |
| `memory_raw` | Quick capture to raw layer |
| `memory_belief` | Add or update beliefs |
| `memory_value` | Define core values |
| `memory_goal` | Set and manage goals |
| `memory_relationship` | Track relationships |
| `memory_playbook_create` | Create procedural playbook |
| `memory_playbook_execute` | Execute a playbook |

### Search & Analysis

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `memory_search` | Semantic search across all memory |
| `memory_belief_contradictions` | Find contradicting beliefs |
| `memory_consolidate` | Get consolidation prompt for reflection |
| `memory_identity_synthesize` | Generate coherent self-model |

### Emotional & Health

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `memory_emotion_tag` | Tag episode with emotional context |
| `memory_anxiety` | Check memory health and get recommendations |

### Suggestions

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `memory_suggestions_list` | List pending suggestions |
| `memory_suggestions_approve` | Accept a suggestion |
| `memory_suggestions_reject` | Decline a suggestion |

## Client Configuration

### Claude Code

Add Kernle as an MCP server using the Claude CLI:

```bash
claude mcp add kernle -- kernle -a <agent_id> mcp
```

This registers Kernle with Claude Code. You can verify with:

```bash
claude mcp list
```

### General MCP Configuration

For clients that use a JSON configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kernle": {
      "command": "kernle",
      "args": ["-a", "<agent_id>", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `<agent_id>` with your actual agent identifier.

## Usage Example

Once configured, your AI assistant can use memory tools naturally:

```
"Let me save my current progress..."
→ Tool call: memory_checkpoint_save(task="Working on user auth")

"What have I learned about caching?"
→ Tool call: memory_search(query="caching")

"I should remember this insight about rate limiting."
→ Tool call: memory_note(content="Rate limits are per-user, not per-key", type="insight")
```

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Session Start**: Always call `memory_load` at the beginning of a session to restore context.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Save Often**: Use `memory_checkpoint_save` before context gets full, not just at session end.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Record Lessons**: Use `memory_episode` with lessons when you learn something significant.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### Server Not Starting

Verify Kernle is installed and accessible:

```bash
which kernle
kernle --version
```

### Tools Not Appearing

1. Restart your MCP client
2. Check the MCP configuration path
3. Verify the agent ID exists: `kernle -a <agent_id> status`

### Permission Issues

The MCP server runs with the same permissions as your user. Ensure `~/.kernle/` is accessible.
