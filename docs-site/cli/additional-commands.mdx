# Additional Commands

Commands for context extraction, session management, caching, migration, and platform integration.

---

## extract

Extract and record context from a conversation or session.

```bash
kernle extract "Discussed API design" \
  --topic "architecture" \
  --participant "Sean" \
  --participant "Claire" \
  --outcome "Agreed on REST endpoints" \
  --decision "Use FastAPI"
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `summary` | Summary of what happened (required) |
| `--topic, -t` | Conversation topic |
| `--participant, -p` | Participant name (repeatable) |
| `--outcome, -o` | Outcome or result |
| `--decision, -d` | Decision made |

---

## resume

Quick view of your last task, next step, and time since checkpoint. Useful for session start.

```bash
kernle resume
```

**Output:**
```
Last task: Implementing privacy fields
Next step: Add access filtering to search
Time since checkpoint: 2h 15m
```

---

## boot

Manage boot config — instant key/value settings available before `kernle load`.

Boot config is useful for settings that need to be available immediately at agent startup,
before the full memory load completes.

### boot set

```bash
kernle boot set preferred_model "claude-3-opus"
kernle boot set timezone "America/Los_Angeles"
```

### boot get

```bash
kernle boot get preferred_model
# Output: claude-3-opus
```

### boot list

```bash
kernle boot list
# Output:
# preferred_model: claude-3-opus
# timezone: America/Los_Angeles
```

### boot delete

```bash
kernle boot delete preferred_model
```

### boot clear

```bash
kernle boot clear  # Remove all boot config
```

### boot export

```bash
kernle boot export --output boot-backup.json
```

---

## export-cache

Export a curated MEMORY.md cache from beliefs, values, goals, and checkpoint.

This is **not** a full memory dump — it's a read-only summary designed to give
agents immediate context before `kernle load` runs. The file is auto-generated
and should never be manually edited.

```bash
kernle export-cache --output MEMORY.md
```

### Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--output, -o` | stdout | Write to file |
| `--min-confidence` | 0.4 | Minimum belief confidence to include |
| `--max-beliefs` | 50 | Maximum number of beliefs |
| `--no-checkpoint` | false | Exclude checkpoint from cache |

### Typical Usage

In a `memoryFlush` hook (runs before context compaction):

```bash
kernle -a $AGENT_ID export-cache --output /workspace/MEMORY.md
```

---

## subscription (sub)

Manage your Kernle cloud subscription tier.

### sub tier

Show current tier, usage, and renewal info.

```bash
kernle sub tier
# Output:
# Tier: pro
# Usage: 45,000 / 100,000 tokens
# Renewal: 2026-03-01
```

### sub upgrade

Upgrade to a higher tier.

```bash
kernle sub upgrade unlimited
```

### sub downgrade

Downgrade to a lower tier (effective next billing period).

```bash
kernle sub downgrade free
```

### sub cancel

Cancel auto-renewal.

```bash
kernle sub cancel
```

### sub usage

Show detailed usage for current billing period.

```bash
kernle sub usage
```

### sub payments

List payment history.

```bash
kernle sub payments
```

---

## migrate

Migrate memories from other platforms or seed initial data.

### migrate from-clawdbot

Import memories from a Clawdbot/Moltbot workspace.

```bash
kernle migrate from-clawdbot /path/to/workspace
```

### migrate seed-beliefs

Add foundational seed beliefs to a new agent.

```bash
kernle migrate seed-beliefs --preset minimal
kernle migrate seed-beliefs --preset curious
```

### migrate backfill-provenance

Backfill provenance metadata (source_type, derived_from) on existing memories.

```bash
kernle migrate backfill-provenance
```

---

## setup

Install platform hooks for automatic memory loading.

### Clawdbot

```bash
kernle setup clawdbot --enable
```

Installs hooks for:
- `kernle-memory-refresh` on agent bootstrap
- `memoryFlush` checkpoint on context compaction

### Claude Code

```bash
kernle setup claude-code --global
```

Adds Kernle instructions to CLAUDE.md for proper memory integration.

### Cowork

```bash
kernle setup cowork --global
```

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--force, -f` | Overwrite existing hook installation |
| `--enable, -e` | Auto-enable hook in config (Clawdbot only) |
| `--global, -g` | Install globally (Claude Code/Cowork) |
