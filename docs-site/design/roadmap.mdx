### Version History

#### v0.03.00 — Protocol & Types Foundation

Established the protocol definitions, shared type system, and plugin discovery mechanism that all subsequent architecture builds on.

- Protocol definitions (CoreProtocol, StackProtocol, PluginProtocol, ModelProtocol, StackComponentProtocol)
- Shared types (`types.py` — all memory dataclasses)
- Discovery system (`discovery.py` — entry point discovery via `importlib.metadata`)

#### v0.04.00 — Core/Stack Split

Separated the coordinator (Entity) from the memory container (SQLiteStack), enabling independent evolution and composability.

- **Entity** — CoreProtocol implementation (coordinator/bus, provenance routing, InferenceService creation)
- **SQLiteStack** — StackProtocol implementation (wraps SQLiteStorage + feature mixins + component registry)
- **Kernle compat layer** — lazy `.entity` and `.stack` properties for backward compatibility
- **Contract tests** — 163 tests for StackProtocol + CoreProtocol conformance
- **CLI migration** — composition info in status, plugin discovery

#### v0.05.00 — Stack Components

Extracted feature mixins into discoverable, composable stack components that can be independently configured.

- **InferenceService** — wraps ModelProtocol with HashEmbedder fallback
- **EmbeddingComponent** — vector embedding via StackComponentProtocol
- **7 feature mixin components** — forgetting, consolidation, emotions, anxiety, suggestions, metamemory, knowledge
- **Component discovery** — auto-loading of 8 default components via entry points

#### v0.06.00 — Plugin System

Added model provider implementations and wired plugin tools through the Entity and MCP server.

- **AnthropicModel + OllamaModel** — ModelProtocol implementations for cloud and local inference
- **Plugin CLI/MCP tool registration** — Entity wiring, namespaced `{plugin_name}.{tool_name}` dispatch
- **MCP dispatch fix** — resolved `validate_tool_input` rejecting plugin tool names

#### v0.07.00 — Plugin Extraction

Moved commerce and communications into independent packages that implement PluginProtocol.

- **chainbased** — PluginProtocol package (wallet, jobs, skills, escrow), comms module removed from kernle
- **fatline** — AgentRegistry + Ed25519 crypto identity, own SQLite DB in plugin data dir
- Both registered as `kernle.plugins` entry points

#### v0.09.00 — Memory Integrity

Introduced provenance enforcement, continuous memory strength replacing binary forgetting, and controlled access with audit trails.

- **Provenance hierarchy enforcement** — `derived_from` required on all memory types except raw, hierarchy rules enforced (Raw->Episode/Note->Belief->Value etc.), ProvenanceError exception for violations
- **Stack lifecycle states** — INITIALIZING/ACTIVE/MAINTENANCE, seed writes only permitted in INITIALIZING
- **Continuous strength** (0.0-1.0) replacing binary `is_forgotten` — 5 tiers: Strong (0.8-1.0), Fading (0.5-0.8), Weak (0.2-0.5), Dormant (0.0-0.2), Forgotten (0.0)
- **Controlled access + audit trail** — named operations (weaken, forget, recover, verify, protect) with `memory_audit` table
- **Strict mode** (`strict=True` default) — enforces provenance and source_type requirements
- **Plugin registration** — live settings sync between stack settings and stack components

#### v0.10.00 — Provenance Wiring + Strength Cascade

Wired provenance through all interfaces (CLI, MCP, core methods), added strength cascade across memory lineage, and enabled component inference.

- **Strength cascade** — reverse-lineage lookup, forget/weaken cascade flags, verify boost to sources, `get_ungrounded_memories`
- **Component inference** — EmotionalTagging + Consolidation call inference when available with keyword fallback
- **CLI provenance** — `derived_from` on relationship add/update, all import commands, value/goal/relationship core methods
- **MCP provenance** — `derived_from`/`source`/`source_type` on all 6 memory creation tools, validation
- **`export-full` command** — complete agent context export as markdown/JSON
- **Memory processing** — MCP tools + CLI (`memory_process`, `memory_process_status`, `kernle process run/status`)
- **Audit fixes** — enforce_provenance=True default, strict=True default, strength-tier gating, on_save mutation persistence

#### v0.11.x — Platform Integration & Architecture

Shipped deep AI runtime integrations, then progressively improved test quality and module architecture across 8 patch releases.

**v0.11.00 — Hook CLI & Platform Integration**

Deep integration with AI runtimes ensures automatic memory capture — not just loading, but writing. Both plugins are shipped and available in the `integrations/` directory.

**OpenClaw Plugin** — Native Plugin SDK integration with lifecycle hooks:

| Plugin Hook | Kernle Use |
|-------------|-----------|
| `before_agent_start` | Load memory at session start (injected as `prependContext`) |
| `agent_end` | Auto-checkpoint with task context + raw entry marking session end |
| `before_tool_call` | Block writes to native memory files (`memory/`, `MEMORY.md`), capture content as Kernle raw entry |
| `tool_result_persist` | Truncate long kernle CLI output to conserve compaction space |

Installation: `cd integrations/openclaw && npm install && npm run build && openclaw plugins install .`

See [OpenClaw Integration](/integration/openclaw) for full details.

**Claude Code Hooks** — Full lifecycle coverage via `kernle hook` CLI commands:

| Hook | Kernle Use |
|------|-----------|
| `SessionStart` | Load memory at session start (injected as `additionalContext`) |
| `PreToolUse` | Block writes to native memory files (`memory/`, `MEMORY.md`), capture content as Kernle raw entry |
| `PreCompact` | Auto-save checkpoint before context compaction |
| `SessionEnd` | Final checkpoint + raw entry on session close |

Installation: `kernle setup claude-code` (writes hooks to `.claude/settings.json`)

No repo access needed — works directly from `pip install kernle`. Configuration via environment variables (`KERNLE_STACK_ID`, `KERNLE_TOKEN_BUDGET`).

See [Claude Code Integration](/integration/claude-code) for full details.

**v0.11.01–v0.11.08 — Architecture Improvements**

- **v0.11.01** — Lazy decay-on-read, provenance migration, component ordering, CLI migration guide, plugin documentation, search regression fix, checkpoint provenance fix
- **v0.11.02** — Fragmented monolithic `sqlite.py` and `core.py` into focused modules
- **v0.11.03** — Refactored MCP `call_tool` to handler registry pattern
- **v0.11.04** — Test coverage for MCP suggestion tools, cloud.py, embeddings.py
- **v0.11.05** — Sync engine tests, belief revision edge cases, tautological test fixes
- **v0.11.06** — Extracted CLI command modules (sync, auth, memory, relations, diagnostic, migrate), CI coverage gate raised to 77%
- **v0.11.07** — Tests for all extracted CLI command modules
- **v0.11.08** — Fragmented `storage/sqlite.py` and `core.py` into focused modules with 80%+ test coverage

## Planned Milestones

Development is organized into versioned milestones. Each minor version (e.g., v0.12.x) is a milestone, with patch versions (e.g., v0.12.00, v0.12.01) as parent issues within. The v0.12.x series addresses critical pipeline integrity findings from a memory pipeline audit, while v0.13.x introduces enriched cognition features and trust enforcement.

### v0.12.00 — Pipeline Safety

<Warning>Critical fixes from the 2026-02-09 memory pipeline audit. These prevent identity corruption when inference is unavailable and establish the suggestions-first governance model.</Warning>

The pipeline audit revealed that `force processing` with `inference_available=false` promoted malformed beliefs and values — identity corruption, not identity continuity. This milestone introduces the invariants that prevent it.

- **No-inference safe-mode** — prevent identity-layer writes when `inference_available=false`; allow only raw capture, basic notes, and suggestions ([#399](https://github.com/emergent-instruments/kernle/issues/399))
- **`source_type` taxonomy** — resolve `"processed"` mismatch; establish canonical SourceType enum aligned with docs ([#400](https://github.com/emergent-instruments/kernle/issues/400))
- **Suggestions-first promotion** — make suggestions the default output of processing; require explicit opt-in for auto-promotion into beliefs/values ([#401](https://github.com/emergent-instruments/kernle/issues/401))
- **Memory lint pass** — reject malformed or low-signal beliefs/values before commit; store failures as suggestions instead ([#402](https://github.com/emergent-instruments/kernle/issues/402))
- **Transition idempotency** — deduplicate by provenance hash and content hash; reprocessing the same batch produces zero duplicates ([#403](https://github.com/emergent-instruments/kernle/issues/403))

### v0.12.01 — Pipeline Robustness

With the safety invariants in place, this milestone makes the pipeline smarter about *when* and *whether* to promote.

- **Time/valence triggers** — wire aging, emotional arousal, and consolidation debt into `check_triggers()` alongside quantity thresholds ([#404](https://github.com/emergent-instruments/kernle/issues/404))
- **Promotion gates** — require minimum evidence count, confidence floor, and trust floor before creating beliefs/values; build on existing strength-tier mechanism ([#405](https://github.com/emergent-instruments/kernle/issues/405))
- **Suggestion resolution workflow** — full lifecycle: list, accept, dismiss, expire; CLI commands, MCP tools, and audit events ([#406](https://github.com/emergent-instruments/kernle/issues/406))
- **Golden snapshot test** — end-to-end pipeline regression test with fixed inputs; covers inference-on/off variants ([#407](https://github.com/emergent-instruments/kernle/issues/407))

### v0.12.02 — Governance & Observability

Auditability and belief management tooling for long-running SIs.

- **Promotion explanations** — store rationale on every promoted memory: trigger condition, evidence list, confidence inputs, trust gate result ([#408](https://github.com/emergent-instruments/kernle/issues/408))
- **Belief revision** — contradiction detection (lexical + embedding), supersession workflow with lineage preservation, downstream impact flagging ([#409](https://github.com/emergent-instruments/kernle/issues/409))
- **JSONL audit events** — standardized, versioned audit event schema with correlation IDs for pipeline runs ([#410](https://github.com/emergent-instruments/kernle/issues/410))
- **Terminology docs** — canonical pipeline diagram, glossary (transition, promotion, suggestion, maintenance, consolidation), end-to-end reference page ([#411](https://github.com/emergent-instruments/kernle/issues/411))
- **Component ordering DAG** — formalize component execution order with declared dependencies; validate at init ([#423](https://github.com/emergent-instruments/kernle/issues/423))

### v0.13.00 — Enriched Cognition

These features extend the existing protocol system with no breaking changes. New capabilities are delivered as StackComponentProtocol implementations or protocol extensions.

#### Memory Echoes

<Note>Partially addressed in v0.09.00/v0.10.00. Strength-tier filtering now excludes weak and dormant memories from `load()` while keeping them searchable — providing a form of peripheral awareness. The explicit echoes metadata below remains future work for richer hints.</Note>

When `load()` excludes memories because of budget limits, those memories are invisible. Memory echoes provide peripheral awareness — lightweight hints about excluded memories ([#412](https://github.com/emergent-instruments/kernle/issues/412)):

```python
"_meta": {
    "echoes": [
        {"type": "belief", "id": "abc", "hint": "testing prevents...", "salience": 0.72},
        {"type": "episode", "id": "def", "hint": "deployed v2 fail...", "salience": 0.68},
    ],
    "temporal_summary": "Memory spans 2024-01-15 to 2026-02-05 (2.1 years). 3 epochs.",
    "topic_clusters": ["deployment", "testing", "collaboration"]
}
```

Echoes cost ~200 tokens for 20 entries but give the entity awareness that relevant memories exist beyond what's currently loaded.

#### Goal Types

Not all goals are the same cognitive object. A `goal_type` field differentiates ([#413](https://github.com/emergent-instruments/kernle/issues/413)):

| Type | Completion Model | Forgetting | Example |
|------|-----------------|-----------|---------|
| `task` | Binary (done/not done) | Normal decay after completion | "Ship v0.3" |
| `aspiration` | Asymptotic (never done) | Very slow decay, protected | "Become a better communicator" |
| `commitment` | Recurring (resets) | No decay while active, protected | "Review PRs within 24 hours" |
| `exploration` | Open-ended (may spawn new goals) | Normal decay | "Investigate distributed consensus" |

#### Belief Enrichment

Two new fields on beliefs to support transfer learning and identity modeling ([#414](https://github.com/emergent-instruments/kernle/issues/414)):

**Belief Scope** — distinguishes self-model beliefs from world-model beliefs:

| Scope | Decay Rate | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `self` | Slow (like values) | "I am a careful reasoner" |
| `world` | Standard | "Testing prevents surprises" |
| `relational` | Standard | "Claire values directness" |

**Domain Metadata** — enables cross-domain transfer:

```python
source_domain: "coding"
cross_domain_applications: ["writing", "teaching"]
abstraction_level: "domain"  # 'specific' | 'domain' | 'universal'
```

#### Plugin Enhancements

| Platform | Hook | Purpose | Issue |
|----------|------|---------|-------|
| Claude Code | `PostToolUse` | Track significant tool calls (Write, Edit, Bash) as raw captures | [#415](https://github.com/emergent-instruments/kernle/issues/415) |
| Claude Code | `UserPromptSubmit` | Inject relevant memory context based on the user's prompt | [#416](https://github.com/emergent-instruments/kernle/issues/416) |

### v0.13.01 — Trust & Access Control

Enforcing trust at the write path — without this, trust is theater.

- **Trust-layer write gating** — require trust evaluation for accepting suggestions, promoting beliefs/values, and loading memory into context; minimum trust thresholds per memory type ([#417](https://github.com/emergent-instruments/kernle/issues/417))
- **Access control & consent enforcement** — implement read/write scopes and export/redaction policies using existing `access_grants`/`consent_grants` fields ([#418](https://github.com/emergent-instruments/kernle/issues/418))
- **Dynamic trust** — compute trust scores from episode history: interaction-based trust, trust decay, self-trust floor at historical accuracy rate ([#419](https://github.com/emergent-instruments/kernle/issues/419))

### v0.13.02 — Scale & Depth

Preparing the memory system for long-running SIs with large memory stores.

- **Load-time memory curation** — token budgeting with "must include" sets (protected values, active goals), priority-ordered allocation, transparent selection reporting ([#420](https://github.com/emergent-instruments/kernle/issues/420))
- **Memory compaction** — fractal summarization and epoch summaries as first-class memory types; inference-gated; summaries preferred by `load()` when budget constrained ([#421](https://github.com/emergent-instruments/kernle/issues/421))
- **Multi-stack merge** — formal merge semantics for values (never auto-merge), beliefs (lineage-aware), and goals (dedup vs supersession); `kernle stack merge --dry-run` ([#422](https://github.com/emergent-instruments/kernle/issues/422))

---

## Further Out: Social & Temporal Depth

These features involve new storage schemas and more sophisticated protocol interactions. Not yet assigned to milestones.

### Relationship History

Currently relationships capture a snapshot. Relationship history tracks the trajectory:

```sql
CREATE TABLE relationship_history (
    relationship_id UUID REFERENCES relationships(id),
    event_type TEXT,       -- 'interaction' | 'trust_change' | 'type_change' | 'note'
    old_value JSONB,
    new_value JSONB,
    episode_id UUID        -- Episode that triggered this change
);
```

This lets the entity answer "How has my relationship with Claire evolved?" without scanning all episodes.

### Entity Models

Beyond tracking relationships, the entity can model what they know *about* another entity:

```sql
CREATE TABLE entity_models (
    entity_name TEXT,
    model_type TEXT,        -- 'behavioral' | 'preference' | 'capability'
    observation TEXT,       -- "Claire is careful with code but overcommits on timelines"
    confidence FLOAT,
    source_episodes UUID[]
);
```

Entity models carry privacy fields (`subject_ids`) since they contain information about others.

### Consolidation Scaffold Enhancements

**Cross-domain pattern scaffolding** — surface structural similarities across domains:

```
Episodes tagged [deployment]:
  "Skipped staging" -> failure
  "Full pipeline" -> success

Episodes tagged [relationships]:
  "Skipped 1:1 prep" -> failure
  "Prepared talking points" -> success

STRUCTURAL SIMILARITY:
  "Shortcutting process -> failure" appears in 2+ domains.
```

**Belief-to-value promotion** — flag beliefs stable enough to be values:

```
Belief: "Iterative development leads to better outcomes"
  - Active for 14 months
  - Reinforced 8 times, never contradicted
  - Referenced across 3 domains
  This belief may have reached value-level stability.
```

**Drive emergence** — surface undeclared drives from behavioral patterns:

```
Behavioral evidence from last 30 days:
  8/12 episodes involved collaboration -> connection evidence (0.65)
  5 episodes mention "teaching" -> reproduction evidence (0.55)
No declared drive matches "connection" or "reproduction."
```

### Entity Model to Belief Promotion

When multiple entity models point toward the same generalization, the scaffold flags it:

```
Observations across entities:
  Claire: "careful with code" -> good outcomes
  Bob: "thorough in reviews" -> good outcomes

Possible generalization: "Thoroughness correlates with quality outcomes"
```

The `derived_from` provenance tracks this abstraction step.

---

## Further Out: Diagnostics & Infrastructure

### Transitive Trust Chains

Trust propagation through relationships: "I trust Claire, Claire trusts Bob, therefore I have derived trust in Bob (at a discount)."

This requires graph-based trust computation with appropriate decay at each hop. Builds on dynamic trust work in v0.13.01.

### Formal Diagnostic Sessions

If the note-based doctor approach proves insufficient, formalize with:

- **Diagnostic session table** with consent model and access levels (`structural` | `content` | `full`)
- **Diagnostic report table** with structured findings and recommendations
- **Trust integration**: Operator-initiated sessions must pass through `gate_memory_input`

The privacy boundary remains: diagnostic reports contain structural findings, not content reproduction. The doctor sees structure; the entity reviews specific memories by ID.

---

## Future Directions

These areas are acknowledged but not yet designed in detail:

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Scope-based inference routing** | Components now declare `inference_scope` ('fast', 'capable', 'embedding', 'none') indicating what kind of model they need. A future core could route `infer()` calls to different models based on scope — e.g., cheap/fast models for tagging, capable models for consolidation, dedicated embedding models for vectors. The declarations are in place; routing is future work. |
| **Embedding strategy** | Current 384-dim vectors may need updating for longer-lived stacks |
| **MCP tool coverage** | Each new table/feature needs corresponding MCP tools |
| **Transfer learning** | Cross-domain belief application with domain metadata (builds on belief enrichment in v0.13.00) |
| **`kernle import` command** | Migration from flat-file memory systems (MEMORY.md, Obsidian, etc.) into stratified memory with heuristic classification and optional LLM-assisted analysis |
