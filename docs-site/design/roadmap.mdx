This roadmap outlines planned features that extend Kernle's cognitive infrastructure. Items are drawn from the Kernle Enhancement Proposals and organized by implementation phase.

## What's Been Built

The core cognitive infrastructure is in place:

  </Card>
  <Card title="Temporal Architecture" icon="clock">

  </Card>
  <Card title="Identity & Trust" icon="fingerprint">
    Self-narrative, trust assessments, authority gating, diagnostics
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Near-Term: Enriched Cognition

These features extend existing patterns with no breaking changes.

### Memory Echoes

When `load()` excludes memories because of budget limits, those memories are invisible. Memory echoes provide peripheral awareness — lightweight hints about excluded memories:

```python
"_meta": {
    "echoes": [
        {"type": "belief", "id": "abc", "hint": "testing prevents...", "salience": 0.72},
        {"type": "episode", "id": "def", "hint": "deployed v2 fail...", "salience": 0.68},
    ],
    "temporal_summary": "Memory spans 2024-01-15 to 2026-02-05 (2.1 years). 3 epochs.",
    "topic_clusters": ["deployment", "testing", "collaboration"]
}
```

Echoes cost ~200 tokens for 20 entries but give the entity awareness that relevant memories exist beyond what's currently loaded.

### Goal Types

Not all goals are the same cognitive object. A `goal_type` field differentiates:

| Type | Completion Model | Forgetting | Example |
|------|-----------------|-----------|---------|
| `task` | Binary (done/not done) | Normal decay after completion | "Ship v0.3" |
| `aspiration` | Asymptotic (never done) | Very slow decay, protected | "Become a better communicator" |
| `commitment` | Recurring (resets) | No decay while active, protected | "Review PRs within 24 hours" |
| `exploration` | Open-ended (may spawn new goals) | Normal decay | "Investigate distributed consensus" |

### Belief Enrichment

Two new fields on beliefs to support transfer learning and identity modeling:

**Belief Scope** — distinguishes self-model beliefs from world-model beliefs:

| Scope | Decay Rate | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `self` | Slow (like values) | "I am a careful reasoner" |
| `world` | Standard | "Testing prevents surprises" |
| `relational` | Standard | "Claire values directness" |

**Domain Metadata** — enables cross-domain transfer:

```python
source_domain: "coding"
cross_domain_applications: ["writing", "teaching"]
abstraction_level: "domain"  # 'specific' | 'domain' | 'universal'
```

---

## Medium-Term: Social & Temporal Depth

### Relationship History

Currently relationships capture a snapshot. Relationship history tracks the trajectory:

```sql
CREATE TABLE agent_relationship_history (
    relationship_id UUID REFERENCES agent_relationships(id),
    event_type TEXT,       -- 'interaction' | 'trust_change' | 'type_change' | 'note'
    old_value JSONB,
    new_value JSONB,
    episode_id UUID        -- Episode that triggered this change
);
```

This lets the entity answer "How has my relationship with Claire evolved?" without scanning all episodes.

### Entity Models

Beyond tracking relationships, the entity can model what they know *about* another entity:

```sql
CREATE TABLE agent_entity_models (
    entity_name TEXT,
    model_type TEXT,        -- 'behavioral' | 'preference' | 'capability'
    observation TEXT,       -- "Claire is careful with code but overcommits on timelines"
    confidence FLOAT,
    source_episodes UUID[]
);
```

Entity models carry privacy fields (`subject_ids`) since they contain information about others.

### Consolidation Scaffold Enhancements

**Cross-domain pattern scaffolding** — surface structural similarities across domains:

```
Episodes tagged [deployment]:
  "Skipped staging" -> failure
  "Full pipeline" -> success

Episodes tagged [relationships]:
  "Skipped 1:1 prep" -> failure
  "Prepared talking points" -> success

STRUCTURAL SIMILARITY:
  "Shortcutting process -> failure" appears in 2+ domains.
```

**Belief-to-value promotion** — flag beliefs stable enough to be values:

```
Belief: "Iterative development leads to better outcomes"
  - Active for 14 months
  - Reinforced 8 times, never contradicted
  - Referenced across 3 domains
  This belief may have reached value-level stability.
```

**Drive emergence** — surface undeclared drives from behavioral patterns:

```
Behavioral evidence from last 30 days:
  8/12 episodes involved collaboration -> connection evidence (0.65)
  5 episodes mention "teaching" -> reproduction evidence (0.55)
No declared drive matches "connection" or "reproduction."
```

### Entity Model to Belief Promotion

When multiple entity models point toward the same generalization, the scaffold flags it:

```
Observations across entities:
  Claire: "careful with code" -> good outcomes
  Bob: "thorough in reviews" -> good outcomes

Possible generalization: "Thoroughness correlates with quality outcomes"
```

The `derived_from` provenance tracks this abstraction step.

## Longer-Term: Dynamic Trust & Full Diagnostics

### Dynamic Trust

Trust scores currently come from manual assessment. Dynamic trust computes scores from episode history:

- **Interaction-based trust**: Track predictions vs outcomes for each entity
- **Trust decay**: Trust scores degrade over time without reinforcement
- **Self-trust floor**: Entity's trust in its own reasoning floored at historical accuracy rate

```python
self_trust_floor = max(0.5, historical_accuracy_rate)
```

### Transitive Trust Chains

Trust propagation through relationships: "I trust Claire, Claire trusts Bob, therefore I have derived trust in Bob (at a discount)."

This requires graph-based trust computation with appropriate decay at each hop.

### Formal Diagnostic Sessions

If the note-based doctor approach proves insufficient, formalize with:

- **Diagnostic session table** with consent model and access levels (`structural` | `content` | `full`)
- **Diagnostic report table** with structured findings and recommendations
- **Trust integration**: Operator-initiated sessions must pass through `gate_memory_input`

The privacy boundary remains: diagnostic reports contain structural findings, not content reproduction. The doctor sees structure; the entity reviews specific memories by ID.

## Future Directions

These areas are acknowledged but not yet designed in detail:

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Multi-stack synthesis** | How to merge context from multiple stacks for richer reasoning |
| **Embedding strategy** | Current 384-dim vectors may need updating for longer-lived stacks |
| **MCP tool coverage** | Each new table/feature needs corresponding MCP tools |
| **Transfer learning** | Cross-domain belief application with domain metadata |
