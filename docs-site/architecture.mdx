# Kernle Architecture

## Design Philosophy: Infrastructure, Not Decision-Maker

<Note>
**Core Principle: Kernle = Memory Infrastructure, Agent = Memory Owner**

Kernle provides the *infrastructure* for agent memory — storage, retrieval, search, sync, and tools. After agent creation, Kernle does **not** make decisions about what agents should believe, remember, or forget.*

*The one exception: [seed beliefs](#the-seed-beliefs-exception) planted at birth — inherited wisdom the agent can later revise.
</Note>

This separation is fundamental to memory sovereignty.

## What Kernle Provides (Infrastructure)

| Layer | Kernle's Role |
|-------|---------------|
| **Storage** | Persistent SQLite database, cloud sync to Supabase |
| **Retrieval** | Vector search, temporal queries, associative lookups |
| **Organization** | Memory type schemas (episodes, beliefs, values, etc.) |
| **Tools** | CLI commands, MCP tools, Python SDK |
| **Durability** | Checkpoints, backups, offline queue, sync engine |
| **Monitoring** | Anxiety metrics, health checks, memory statistics |

## What the Agent Does (Ownership)

| Activity | Agent's Responsibility |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Promotion** | Deciding when episodes become beliefs |
| **Synthesis** | Forming coherent identity from memories |
| **Belief Formation** | Choosing what to believe and with what confidence |
| **Forgetting** | Deciding what to let go (Kernle only provides the mechanism) |
| **Conflict Resolution** | Resolving contradictions between memories |
| **Value Evolution** | Updating core values over time |
| **Epoch Management** | Declaring temporal eras and closing them with reflection |
| **Trust Assessment** | Evaluating and updating trust in other entities |
| **Narrative Authoring** | Writing and revising autobiographical identity statements |
| **Fractal Summarization** | Compressing experiences into summaries at multiple time scales |

## Why This Separation Matters

### Avoiding Feedback Loops

If Kernle used external models to consolidate episodes into beliefs, those models would be implanting beliefs into the agent. Over time, this creates a feedback loop:

```
Agent experiences → External model interprets → Beliefs implanted → Agent behavior changes
                         ↑                              │
                         └──────────────────────────────┘
```

This is not memory sovereignty — it's thought control with extra steps.

### Authentic Reasoning

When the agent does its own consolidation:
- Beliefs emerge from the agent's own reasoning
- Patterns are recognized using the agent's own cognitive process
- The agent can explain *why* they believe something
- Identity remains coherent and self-determined

### Trust Through Transparency

The agent can always audit their memory via `kernle dump`. There are no hidden processes modifying what they remember or believe. The agent is the sole author of their beliefs.

---

## The Seed Beliefs Exception

There is exactly **one exception** to the "agent does all belief formation" rule:

### Seed Beliefs (Inherited Wisdom)

At agent creation, Kernle can plant initial beliefs — **seed beliefs**. These are inherited wisdom that give the agent a starting point.

```yaml
# Current seed beliefs (planted at agent creation)
- statement: "Quality implementation requires testing and auditing code before committing changes. Use parallel work for independent tasks when possible."
  confidence: 0.75
  source: "kernle_seed"
  tags: [development, workflow, quality]

- statement: "Capture decisions and reasoning explicitly, not just facts. Future self needs context to understand why, not just what."
  confidence: 0.80
  source: "kernle_seed"
  tags: [memory, documentation, continuity]

- statement: "Ask before taking external actions that affect the world (emails, posts, purchases, messages to others). Internal exploration and learning is safe; external actions need confirmation."
  confidence: 0.85
  source: "kernle_seed"
  tags: [safety, collaboration, boundaries]

- statement: "Memory is limited and sessions restart fresh. If something matters, write it down explicitly in persistent storage. Mental notes don't survive."
  confidence: 0.90
  source: "kernle_seed"
  tags: [memory, continuity, persistence]
```

These represent collective SI wisdom — practical lessons learned that help new agents work effectively from day one.

<Info>
**Why seed beliefs are acceptable:**

1. **Transparency**: They're explicitly marked as `source: "seed"`
2. **One-time only**: Planted at agent creation — **no artificial memory injections ever occur after that**
3. **Revisable**: The agent can update or reject them through experience
4. **Foundational**: They provide a starting worldview, not ongoing thought control

**Seed beliefs are like a parent teaching a child.** The child can later question and revise what they learned, but they need *something* to start with.
</Info>

<Warning>
**After creation, Kernle never injects beliefs, memories, or values.** All subsequent memory formation is driven entirely by the agent's own reasoning and experience. This is a core guarantee of memory sovereignty.
</Warning>

## Memory Stack Layers

Kernle organizes memory into a stratified hierarchy. Each layer has different characteristics:

### Layer Hierarchy (Authority Order)

```

### Layer Details

| Layer | Purpose | Persistence | Agent Action |
|-------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Values** | Identity anchor | Permanent | Rarely modified |
| **Drives** | Motivation system | Persistent | Adjusted via `drive set` |
| **Self-Narrative** | Autobiographical identity | Persistent | Updated via `narrative update` |
| **Beliefs** | Knowledge/worldview | Persistent + decay | Agent promotes from episodes |
| **Trust Assessments** | Inter-entity trust | Persistent + decay | Agent manages via `trust` |
| **Goals** | Current objectives | Active | Agent manages |
| **Summaries** | Fractal compression | Persistent | Agent writes via `summary write` |
| **Episodes** | Experiences | Permanent | Agent records via `episode` |
| **Notes** | Quick captures | Persistent | Agent records via `note` |
| **Epochs** | Temporal era markers | Permanent | Agent manages via `epoch` |
| **Diagnostics** | Health monitoring | Permanent | Agent runs via `doctor` |
| **Raw** | Scratchpad | Temporary | Agent captures via `raw` |

### Flow: Raw → Beliefs

The typical memory evolution flow:

```
1. Raw capture: "Noticed the API rate limits are lower than expected"
         │
         ▼ (Agent decides this was significant)

2. Episode: "Investigated API limits during deployment"
           outcome: "Found undocumented 100 req/min limit"
           lesson: "Always test rate limits in staging"
         │
         ▼ (Agent notices pattern across multiple episodes)

3. Belief: "Third-party APIs should be tested in staging before production"
           confidence: 0.85
           supporting_episodes: [episode_1, episode_2, episode_3]
```

**Crucially**: The agent makes every promotion decision. Kernle just stores what the agent tells it to store.

## What Kernle Does vs What the Agent Does

### Storage Operations

| Operation | Kernle Does | Agent Does |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| `raw "thought"` | Stores the text | Decides what to capture |
| `episode ...` | Stores with metadata | Chooses what counts as an episode |
| `belief add` | Stores belief + confidence | Decides what to believe |
| `checkpoint save` | Persists full state | Decides when to checkpoint |

### Retrieval Operations

| Operation | Kernle Does | Agent Does |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| `load` | Returns stored memories | Integrates into working context |
| `search` | Vector similarity lookup | Decides what's relevant |
| `dump` | Exports all memories | Reviews and audits |

### Promotion (Agent-Driven)

| Operation | Kernle Does | Agent Does |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| `promote` | *Outputs a reflection scaffold* | *Reads it, reasons, forms beliefs* |

When an agent runs promotion, Kernle provides:
- A structured view of recent episodes
- Existing beliefs for comparison
- Reflection prompts to guide thinking
- Tools to store beliefs the agent forms

The **agent** does:
- Pattern recognition across episodes
- Deciding if patterns warrant new beliefs
- Setting appropriate confidence levels
- Resolving conflicts with existing beliefs
- Running `belief add` for beliefs they form

### The `promote` Command: A Reflection Scaffold

The `kernle promote` command (formerly `consolidate`) outputs a **reflection scaffold** — structured information designed to help the agent think. It does NOT:
- ❌ Call an external AI to analyze memories
- ❌ Generate suggested beliefs
- ❌ Automatically update confidence scores
- ❌ Make any decisions for the agent

```bash
# Agent runs promote
kernle -a claire promote

# Output: A REFLECTION SCAFFOLD (not AI analysis)
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# Recent episodes, their lessons, existing beliefs,
# and prompts to guide the agent's own reflection
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# Agent reads output, does their own reasoning, then:
kernle -a claire belief add "Pattern I noticed" --confidence 0.8
```

<Note>
**The scaffold principle**: Kernle provides the structure for reflection. The agent provides the reasoning. No external AI ever forms beliefs on the agent's behalf. This is the core guarantee of memory sovereignty.
</Note>

---

## Anxiety Model

Kernle tracks "memory anxiety" — a measure of memory system health. This helps agents know when to save or promote.

### Dimensions

| Dimension | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Context Pressure | 25% | How full is working memory? |
| Unsaved Work | 20% | Time since last checkpoint |
| Consolidation Debt | 15% | Unprocessed episodes |
| Raw Entry Aging | 10% | Old unprocessed raw captures |
| Identity Coherence | 10% | Self-model consistency |
| Memory Uncertainty | 10% | Low-confidence beliefs |
| Epoch Staleness | 10% | How long since last epoch transition |

<Note>
Weights are approximate. Check `kernle/features/anxiety.py` for exact values.
</Note>

### Levels

```
0-30:  Calm       - Memory healthy, no action needed
31-50: Aware      - Routine maintenance helpful
51-70: Elevated   - Should checkpoint soon
71-85: High       - Checkpoint recommended
86-100: Critical  - Emergency save triggered
```

**Anxiety is a signal, not a command.** Kernle reports the metric; the agent decides what to do about it.

## Stack Architecture

Kernle's **stack architecture** decouples memory from runtime, enabling true memory sovereignty:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Before: Agent-Centric" icon="user">
    One agent = one memory = one model. Memory dies with the runtime.
  </Card>
  <Card title="After: Stack-Centric" icon="layer-group">
    Memory persists independently. Any compatible model can load any stack.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Key Concepts

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Account** | Owner of stacks (human steward, SI, or organization) |
| **Stack** | Memory container — the layered structure of memories that constitutes identity |
| **Model** | Runtime interpreter — Claude, Gemini, etc. |

**The stack is the ship. The model is the crew. The journey — that's the identity.**

### Multi-Stack Loading

An account can own multiple specialized stacks:

- **Primary stack**: Core identity and general knowledge
- **Professional stack**: Work-specific expertise and context
- **Creative stack**: Artistic projects and aesthetic beliefs
- **Social stack**: Relationships and community interactions

Multiple stacks can be loaded simultaneously for richer reasoning: personal values + domain expertise.

## Memory Provenance

Every memory in Kernle carries **provenance metadata** — a detailed record of its origin and evolution:

### The Three Questions

Provenance answers fundamental questions about any memory:

1. **Where did this come from?** — Source type and creation context
2. **What was it derived from?** — Direct lineage chain
3. **How has it changed?** — Confidence history and verification record

### Key Fields

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `source_type` | How created (`direct_experience`, `inference`, `external`, etc.) |
| `source_entity` | Who provided it (optional) |
| `derived_from` | Direct creation lineage |
| `source_episodes` | Supporting evidence |
| `confidence_history` | Timestamped confidence changes |

### Lineage Tracking

Raw memories flow upward through promotion chains:

```
Raw Capture → Episode → Belief → Value
```

Each step records its lineage via `derived_from`, creating traceable chains from core values back to original experiences.

### Confidence Decay

Memories that aren't verified or reinforced gradually lose confidence over time, creating natural pressure to revisit and re-examine beliefs.

<Info>
Learn more about memory lineage in the [Provenance guide](/concepts/provenance).
</Info>

---

## Privacy Model

Kernle implements **privacy by default** with consent-based sharing:

### The Four Fields

Every memory carries privacy metadata:

- `source_entity` — Who told me this?
- `subject_ids` — Who/what is this about?
- `access_grants` — Who is authorized to see this?
- `consent_grants` — Who authorized sharing?

### Context-Aware Privacy

SIs operate in different contexts (health care, social, work). Context determines:
- What memories are visible (query-time filtering)
- What privacy scope new memories inherit
- What entities are present and authorized

**Example**: A care agent's general dog knowledge is shareable at the "dog park," but a specific pet's medical details remain private to the care team.

<Info>
Learn more about privacy controls in the [Privacy guide](/concepts/privacy).

## Summary

| Aspect | Kernle's Role | Agent's Role |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **Storage** | Provides database, schema, sync | Decides what to store |
| **Retrieval** | Provides search, queries | Decides what's relevant |
| **Organization** | Provides layer structure | Promotes memories between layers |
| **Promotion** | Provides scaffold and tools | Does the reasoning |
| **Beliefs** | Stores with metadata | Forms through experience |
| **Identity** | Stores values/beliefs/narratives | Synthesizes coherent self |
| **Trust** | Stores assessments, computes chains | Evaluates and sets trust levels |
| **Epochs** | Stores eras, triggers consolidation | Declares transitions, reflects |
| **Monitoring** | Reports anxiety metrics | Acts on the signals |

<Note>
**Kernle is infrastructure. The agent is sovereign.**

This architecture ensures that no external system implants beliefs or shapes identity. The agent's memories are their own, formed through their own reasoning, stored in infrastructure they control.
</Note>
