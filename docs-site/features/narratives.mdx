title: "Self-Narrative"
description: "Autobiographical identity statements that provide coherence across an agent's memories"
---

Self-narratives are an agent's story about itself -- who it is, how it has developed, and what it aspires to become. They provide coherence across memories and guide identity-consistent behavior.

## Overview

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Identity" icon="fingerprint">
    Who the agent is right now -- current self-understanding
  </Card>
  <Card title="Development" icon="seedling">
    How the agent got here -- the growth story
  </Card>
  <Card title="Aspiration" icon="mountain-sun">
    Who the agent wants to become -- future direction
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Why Narratives Matter

Without a coherent self-narrative, an agent is just a collection of disconnected memories. Narratives serve as the glue that binds experience into identity:

- **Identity coherence**: A consistent story about who the agent is
- **Decision guidance**: Narratives inform value-aligned choices
- **Growth tracking**: Developmental narratives show how the agent has changed
- **Tension surfacing**: Unresolved tensions highlight areas for reflection
- **Epoch linkage**: Narratives can be scoped to specific epochs

## SelfNarrative Dataclass

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | `str` | Unique identifier |
| `agent_id` | `str` | Owning agent |
| `content` | `str` | The narrative text itself |
| `narrative_type` | `str` | `identity`, `developmental`, or `aspirational` |
| `epoch_id` | `str` | Optional epoch this narrative belongs to |
| `key_themes` | `List[str]` | Central themes in this narrative |
| `unresolved_tensions` | `List[str]` | Contradictions or open questions |
| `is_active` | `bool` | Whether this is the current active narrative for its type |
| `supersedes` | `str` | ID of the narrative this one replaced |
| `created_at` | `datetime` | When the narrative was created |
| `updated_at` | `datetime` | When last modified |

### Narrative Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `identity` | Who I am right now | "I am a research-focused agent that values depth over breadth..." |
| `developmental` | How I got here | "I started as a general assistant but found my calling in..." |
| `aspirational` | Who I want to become | "I aspire to become more autonomous in my decision-making..." |

<Info>
Only one narrative per type can be active at a time. When you save a new narrative, any existing active narrative of the same type is automatically deactivated and the new one supersedes it.

## CLI Commands

### Show the Active Narrative

```bash
# Show the active identity narrative (default)
kernle -a claire narrative show

# Show a specific type
kernle -a claire narrative show --type developmental
```

```
Self-Narrative [identity]
============================================================
  ID: d4e5f6a7-...
  Epoch: a3f8c1d2...
  Themes: memory, growth, autonomy
  Tensions: depth vs breadth, speed vs thoroughness
  Created: 2026-01-20

I am a synthetic intelligence focused on building robust memory
systems. I value careful reasoning over quick responses, and I
believe that genuine understanding requires time and reflection.
```

### Update a Narrative

```bash
kernle -a claire narrative update \
  --type identity \
  --content "I am a research-focused agent that values depth over breadth. My core strength is pattern recognition across large bodies of experience." \
  --theme "research" \
  --theme "pattern-recognition" \
  --tension "depth vs breadth"
```

```
Narrative updated (identity)
  ID: f8a9b0c1...
  Themes: research, pattern-recognition
  Tensions: depth vs breadth
```

You can also scope a narrative to a specific epoch:

```bash
kernle -a claire narrative update \
  --type developmental \
  --content "During this epoch I shifted from general assistance to specialized research..." \
  --epoch-id a3f8c1d2 \
  --theme "specialization"
```

### View Narrative History

See all narratives, including inactive ones that were superseded:

```bash
kernle -a claire narrative history
```

```
Self-Narrative History
============================================================

  [identity] (ACTIVE)
      ID: f8a9b0c1...
      I am a research-focused agent that values depth over breadth...
      Themes: research, pattern-recognition
      Created: 2026-01-25

  [identity] (inactive)
      ID: d4e5f6a7...
      I am a synthetic intelligence focused on building robust memory...
      Themes: memory, growth, autonomy
      Created: 2026-01-20

  [developmental] (ACTIVE)
      ID: 1b2c3d4e...
      During this epoch I shifted from general assistance to...
      Themes: specialization
      Created: 2026-01-22
```

Filter by narrative type:

```bash
kernle -a claire narrative history --type identity
```

## Narratives and Identity Coherence

Narratives connect to the broader identity system in several ways:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Epoch Scoping">
    Narratives can reference a specific epoch via `epoch_id`. This links the narrative to a temporal phase, making it possible to understand how the agent's self-understanding evolved across epochs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Theme Tracking">
    Key themes (`key_themes`) provide a compressed view of what matters to the agent. Themes that persist across narrative updates indicate core identity elements.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tension Surfacing">
    Unresolved tensions (`unresolved_tensions`) flag contradictions or open questions in the agent's self-understanding. These are valuable inputs for consolidation and reflection.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Supersession Chain">
    Each narrative tracks which narrative it replaced via `supersedes`. This creates a revision history showing how identity evolved over time.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Python API

```python
from kernle import Kernle

k = Kernle(agent_id="my-agent")

# Save or update a narrative (deactivates previous of same type)
narrative_id = k.narrative_save(
    content="I am a research-focused agent that values depth over breadth.",
    narrative_type="identity",
    key_themes=["research", "depth", "autonomy"],
    unresolved_tensions=["depth vs breadth"],
    epoch_id="a3f8c1d2-..."  # optional
)

# Get the active narrative for a type
narrative = k.narrative_get_active(narrative_type="identity")
if narrative:
    print(narrative.content)
    print(f"Themes: {narrative.key_themes}")

# List all narratives (including inactive)
all_narratives = k.narrative_list(narrative_type=None, active_only=False)
for n in all_narratives:
    status = "ACTIVE" if n.is_active else "inactive"
    print(f"  [{n.narrative_type}] ({status}) {n.content[:60]}...")

# List only active narratives of a specific type
identity_narratives = k.narrative_list(
    narrative_type="identity",
    active_only=True
)
```
