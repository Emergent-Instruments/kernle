Project Notes

The memory system should handle concurrent access gracefully.
Each agent maintains its own isolated memory stack.
Cross-agent memory sharing requires explicit trust establishment.

Performance targets: sub-100ms for single memory operations.
Batch processing should handle 1000+ entries per cycle.

Key insight: provenance tracking is essential for memory integrity.
Without it, the system cannot distinguish evidence from speculation.
