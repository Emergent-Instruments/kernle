# Architecture Overview

The system uses a layered memory architecture with strict provenance tracking.

## Memory Layers

Raw entries form the foundation. Everything starts as unstructured capture.
Episodes represent structured experiences with objectives and outcomes.
Beliefs are generalizations derived from multiple episodes.
Values are core principles promoted from strongly-held beliefs.

## Processing Pipeline

The processing pipeline promotes memories up the hierarchy automatically.
Each transition requires sufficient evidence before promotion occurs.
Identity-layer transitions require model inference for quality assurance.

## Design Principles

Memory sovereignty means the agent controls its own memory lifecycle.
Provenance tracking ensures every memory can trace back to its sources.
Strength-based gating prevents premature promotion of weak memories.
